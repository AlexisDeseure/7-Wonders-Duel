	If no player has won a victory through supremacy before the end of Age III, the
	player who has the most victory points wins the game.
	To determine your total, add:
		• Your military victory points (0, 2, 5, or 10 depending on the position of
		the Conflict pawn).
		• Victory points from your Buildings (blue,green,yellow, and purple
		cards).
		• Victory points from your Wonders.
		• Your victory points from Progress.
		• Your city’s treasury: each complete set of 3 coins is worth 1 point.
		In the case where both players are tied, the player who has the most victory
		points from their Civilian Buildings (blue cards) wins the game. If this is also a
		tie, then both players share their victory
